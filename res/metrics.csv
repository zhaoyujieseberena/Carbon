It comprises both its inherent consumption and the job's share (or tax) of embodied and other costs. For example, a machine learning model derived from a base model needs to account for adding a portion of the original model's tax."

It balances embodied carbon emissions and performance. <br>**CEP** is the product of embodied carbon and energy. It balances embodied carbon emissions and energy consumption for chips. <br> They can serve as optimization targets.
