Conputing energy is the energy directly used for computing rather than for cooling and other support systems It can more directly reflect the carbon efficiency of a data center than PUE. 
GPUE,Operation,Datacenter,Infrastructure,N/A,**GPUE**<br>Green Power Usage Effectivenes ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8701895,PUE or GPUE: A carbon-aware metric for data centers.,"$G\cdot PUE\quad (kg/kwh)$<br>$G=\Sigma_i CI_{souce\, i}\cdot Weight_{source\, i}$",**GPUE** is average produced carbon per computing energy in a data center. Conputing energy is the energy directly used for computing rather than for cooling and other support systems It can also more directly reflect the impace of different energy source in the data center than CUE.
CCI,"Operation,  Manufacturing, End-of-life",Datacenter,Platform,N/A,**CCI**<br>Computational Carbon Intensity,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06870,Junkyard computing: repurposing discarded smartphones to minimize carbon,"$\frac{CO_{2\,equip}}{Operations} \quad (kg)$",**CCI** describes the average carbon footprint per operation for an IT equiment. It characterizes the device's consumption based on workload rather than using time.

Version 1.0.0. (Nov. 1, 2021).","$\frac{CO_{2\,app}}{Operations}\quad  (kg)$",**SCI** describes the average carbon footprint per operation for an application. It can describe carbon consumption at a finer granularity than CCI.

A ""job"" can vary in scale from a network packet to a massive DNN model. It can describe carbon consumption at a finer granularity, such as at the thread level."
JSC,Operation,"Datacenter, Mobile, Edge, Tiny",Application,OS,**JSC**<br>Job Sustainability Costs ,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10353075,Metrics for Sustainability in Data Centers,$(Energy_{app}+App\quad tax) \cdot CI \quad (kg)$,"**ASC** represents the operational CO2e emissions during the execution of an application. It comprises both its inherent consumption and the job's share (or tax) of embodied and other costs. For example, in the case of a machine learning model derived from a base model, it needs to account for adding a portion of the original model's tax."

It balances embodied carbon emissions and performance. <br>**CEP** is the product of embodied carbon and energy. It balances embodied carbon emissions and energy consumption for chips. <br> They can serve as optimization targets.
