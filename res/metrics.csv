GPUE,Operation,Datacenter,Infrastructure,N/A,**GPUE**<br>Green Power Usage Effectivenes ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8701895,PUE or GPUE: A carbon-aware metric for data centers.,$\Sigma(  \text { Job} \times(1+\text { weight }))\cdot CCI$,**GPUE** describes the carbon footprint per kilowatt in computing tasks. It can more directly reflect the carbon efficiency of a data center than PUE.
CUE,Operation,Datacenter,Infrastructure,N/A,**CUE**<br>Carbon Usage Effectiveness,https://airatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Green-Grid-White-Paper-32-CUE-Usage-Guidelines.pdf,Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE): A Green Grid Data Center Sustainability Metric.,$t \cdot \text {Carbon} \cdot \text {Power(Energy)}$,**CUE** is average produced carbon per computing power in a data center. It can more directly reflect the carbon efficiency of a data center than PUE. It can also more directly reflect the amount of sustainable energy in the data center than GPUE.
CCI,"Operation,  Manufacturing, End-of-life",Datacenter,Platform,N/A,**CCI**<br>Computational Carbon Intensity,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06870,Junkyard computing: repurposing discarded smartphones to minimize carbon,$\text {Carbon} \cdot \text {Power(Energy)}$,**CCI** describes the average carbon footprint per computing task for a device. It characterizes the device's resource consumption based on workload rather than time.
SCI,"Operation,  Manufacturing, End-of-life","Datacenter, Mobile, Edge, Tiny",Application,Application,**SCI**<br>Software Carbon Intensity ,https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/sci/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md,"Software Carbon Intensity Standard. Version 1.0.0. (Nov. 1, 2021).",$\Sigma(  \text { Source } \times(1+\text { weight }))\cdot PUE$,**SCI** describes the average carbon footprint per computing task for an application. It can describe carbon consumption at a finer granularity than CCI.
ASC,"Operation,  Manufacturing","Datacenter, Mobile, Edge, Tiny",Application,Application,**ASC**<br>Amortized Sustainability Costs,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10353075,Metrics for Sustainability in Data Centers,$1+\frac{Non IT Facility Energy }{ IT Equipment Energy }$,"**ASC** represents the operational CO2e emissions during the execution of an application. It comprises both its inherent consumption and the job's share (or tax) of embodied and other costs. For example, in the case of a machine learning model derived from a base model, it needs to account for adding a portion of the original model's tax."
JSC,Operation,"Datacenter, Mobile, Edge, Tiny",Application,OS,**JSC**<br>Job Sustainability Costs ,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10353075,Metrics for Sustainability in Data Centers,$1+\frac{\text { Non IT Facility Carbon}}{\text { IT Equipment Carbon }}$,"**JSC** is the operational CO2 spent while running a job. A ""job"" can vary in scale from a network packet to a massive DNN model. It can describe carbon consumption at a finer granularity, such as at the thread level."
CDP/CEP,"Operation,  Manufacturing","Datacenter, Mobile, Edge, Tiny",Application,Microarchitecture,**CDP/CEP** Product of Carbon Delay/Energy ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122998,ACT: Designing Sustainable Computer Systems With An Architectural Carbon Modeling Tool,$\frac{\text{Carbon}}{\text{Energy}}$,**CDP** is the product of embodied carbon and delay for a chip. It balances embodied carbon emissions and performance. <br>**CEP** is the product of embodied carbon and energy. It balances embodied carbon emissions and energy consumption for chips. <br> They can serve as optimization targets.
tCDP/tCEP,"Operation,  Manufacturing","Datacenter, Mobile, Edge, Tiny",Application,Microarchitecture,**tCDP/tCEP** <br> Product of total CO2 and total application execution time,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01831,Design Space Exploration and Optimization for Carbon-Efficient Extended Reality Systems,$\Sigma(  \text { Intensity } \times(1+\text { weight }))\cdot CCI$,"**tCDP**  is the product of carbon within a specified time period, t and delay for a chip. The carbon includes both the operations conducted during this time and the amortized embodied carbon. <br> **tCEP** is the product of carbon within a specified time period, t and delay   <br> They can serve as an optimization target. <br> They can provide a more comprehensive calculation of carbon.
